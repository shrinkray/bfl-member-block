A WP Block Plugin to build content membership levels in a makerspace



### == Description ==

This is a block plugin to work in combination with other blocks. The purpose is to present info about each level of membership, such as what ammenities are included, as an example. Configuration and options within the block are handled with ACF fields. Building this block was to learn how to build and customize Block plugins. 

The process and useful links will be published in my [blog](https://www.shrinkraylabs.com) soon. This work was based on a [post](https://wpengine.com/builders/accordion-block-acf-fields/) published by WP Engine where they are building an Accordion block and uses boilerplate [create-block templating](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@colorful-tones/acf-create-block-template) from Damon Cook. 


## == Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, then activate.
2. On your page, search the blocks for 'rental' 
3. Editing takes place in the page like old-school ACF. 
4. Add rental spaces and reorder in the edit view if you like. 
5. Save and View changes.
